      Ember could not be the incredible framework it is, without companies helping fund
      its progress. Whether you need an Ember addon to implement your favorite
      library in native Ember, a custom Ember data adapter for your API setup,
      or changes to Ember itself, sponsored open source development can help
      give back to the community, while also solving your business needs.
